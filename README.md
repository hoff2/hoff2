My name is Chuck. I live in Des Moines, Iowa, and I am a software developer. You
can probably hire me right about now; I'm pretty good and might not be feeling
too picky right now, what with the world cracking apart and all. I'm adaptable
at using a variety of technologies and get off on learning new ones -- or even
old ones.

You should definitely have a look at my [website](https://hoff2.dev).
